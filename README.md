# Computing-Ethics-Narratives-
New pedagogical approaches for teaching and assessing ethics across the computer science curricula

Although the critical nature of embedded ethics instruction within computer science (CS) curricula has been well established over the last fifty years (Weiner, 1956; Moor, 1985; Gotterbarn, 1995; Floridi, 1999; Brey, 2000; Johnson, 2001), there remains significant barriers to infusing evidence-based ethics instruction across the computer science core content areas. These barriers include competing domain approaches, lack of evidence-based evaluation of approach effectiveness, and resistance among computer science faculty to the integration of ethics instruction into core course content. The goal of the Computing Ethics Narratives proposal is to provide a pedagogical approach with an emphasis on providing computing ethics instruction through an interdisciplinary lens.

This project is grounded in the construction of narratives as "ethical laboratories" that allow students to experiment with the ethical implications of a given plot (Ricoeur,1992). We believe this approach will help computer science students to develop critical thinking skills needed to evaluate, as an individual and as a member of a technical team, the potential ethical impact of technology before, during, and after the technology development and testing processes. Framing ethics instruction around narratives allows for the integration of a variety of input into the ‘lab’ such as fictional narratives (e.g., sci- fi and literature), personal narratives (e.g., interviews), and organizational narratives (e.g., case studies) that demonstrate how the creators of technologies have a profound impact on our present and future society. One of the primary benefits of this narrative approach is that it is applicable to the development of individual ethics as well as social ethics (Devon, 2004). The plot of the narrative makes explicit how different types of narratives are woven together through a set of individual and group ethical decision-making to create the fabric of social institutions. 

In order to improve current efforts of computing ethics instruction specifically for small, liberal arts environments, this project activities include: 1) development of tools to assess the effectiveness of implicit and explicit computing ethics instruction in core computer science and digital computational studies programs, 2) development and assessment of explicit curricula for embedding computing ethics as a partnership between CS students and faculty, and 3) organization of a summer workshop to disseminate and share findings/resources among peer and regional institutions in New England.(2206/2500)
